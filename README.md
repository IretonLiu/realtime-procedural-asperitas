# Asperitas Cloud Simulation

This repository contains a real-time simulation of **Asperitas clouds**, combining **volumetric rendering** with **FFT-based wave simulation** to generate realistic, dynamic cloud formations.

This project merges two distinct techniques:

1. **Procedural volumetric rendering** â€“ generates complex 3D cloud structures using noise functions.
2. **FFT-based wave simulation** â€“ traditionally used for ocean surfaces, adapted here to simulate the rolling motion of clouds.

## ðŸ”¹ About the Project

Asperitas clouds are rare, dramatic cloud formations characterized by wave-like undulations. Traditional cloud simulation techniques often struggle to capture their dynamic complexity. By integrating procedural volumetrics and FFT wave simulations, this project creates a visually compelling and physically inspired representation of Asperitas clouds.

Key features include:

* Fully procedural volumetric clouds using noise textures.
* Dynamic undulations influenced by FFT-based wave simulation.
* Real-time rendering suitable for exploration and visualization.

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works

### Procedural Volumetric Rendering

Volumetric rendering represents clouds as 3D density fields rather than flat textures. In this project, **procedural noise** is used to generate density and detail at multiple scales, producing realistic turbulence and texture.

### FFT-Based Wave Simulation

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques are typically used for simulating ocean surfac
